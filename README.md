## Firestick Interactive

### DESC: 
A great game for kids of all ages.
 
### NOTES:
- The code is divided up into different sketches which represent
components of the Firestick Interactive.
- There's one model of energy used throughout the experience
which unlocks 'stages' and triggers associated events.
- To tweak the experience, you should first look at modifying
the 'difficulty' variable, the difference between energy stages in
the 'energy_levels' array, or the 'cooling_amount'.
